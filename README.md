# Math Magician

# Quick Pitch

Math Magician is a simple game about a little wizard who happens to land himself in some deep trouble, quite literally. On a nice evening whilst he was collecting food the child fell into the underground with nothing more than a small pouch of magical number crystals. He must now traverse the unknown and climb ever higher until he reaches the surface. There are dangerous creatures afoot, but this wizard is unnaturally athletic allowing him to freely traverse and platform through a 2-d environment collecting number crystals which he can use to decimate enemies with the power of mathematics.

# Basic Gameplay/Controls

Explore a 2-d area and collect number crystals. Engage in combat with enemies by colliding with them.

Combat explanation: Your number crystals are displayed at the bottom along with how many you have of each. Your health is displayed below your character. Likewise, the enemy's health is displayed beneath their character and their attack value above their head. The goal is to combine number crystals to do damage, reducing the enemy's health to 0.
